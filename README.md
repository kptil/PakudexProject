# PakudexProject

## Description

This project defines Pakuri objects and Pakudex objects in separate classes and uses these objects to create a user interface with options to save new Pakuri in their Pakudex, sort existing Pakuri, and update a Pakuri's capabilities by evolving. Each Pakuri object is initialized with a species name and attack, defense, and speed scores based on the length of the species name. A Pakudex object is an array which can be initialized with a default or specified size. Two test harnesses ensure the methods defined in the Pakuri and Pakudex classes are working as expected. The program running the user interface is saved in the PakuriProgram class.

## Authorship

I completed this project in Spring 2021 for a programming class at the University of Florida. I wrote all the code in all the uploaded files.
